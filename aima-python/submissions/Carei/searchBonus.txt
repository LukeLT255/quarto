+10: An instance that yields a better solution with BFS than DFS
+10: An instance that yields a better solution with UCS than BFS

Both are satisfied by: fayette_puzzle = search.GraphProblem('Markleysburg', 'Connellsville', fayette_map)

Added Coordinates

+10: All instances run without exceptions, and generate valid output for, BestFS and A*

+10: An instance yields a better solution with BestFS than with arbitrary DFS
Also satisfied by: fayette_puzzle = search.GraphProblem('Markleysburg', 'Connellsville', fayette_map)

+10: An instance yields a better solution with BFS than BestFS
Satisfied by: fayette_puzzle = search.GraphProblem('Perryopolis', 'Markleysburg', fayette_map)

+10: UCS finds a solution at least 1 move deep.

+10: UCS finds a solution at least 2 moves deep.

+10: UCS finds a solution at least 4 moves deep.
