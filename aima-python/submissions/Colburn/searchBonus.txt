1. An instance that yields a better solution with BFS than DFS 10
2. An instance that yields a better solution with UCS than BFS 10
3. A sliding puzzle problem.
	-UCS finds a solution one move deep 10
	-contains at least 50 states 35
	
4. Added coordinates to my map
	- All instances ran and generate output for BestFS and A* 10
	-An instance where BFS is better than BestFs10
	-A* expands less nodes then UFC.10
